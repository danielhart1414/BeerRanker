# BeerRanker
This Java program allows the user to rank their beer preferences. It displays the user's current preference list and allows the user to add to the list, remove from the list, revise a list item, and display their favorite beer. As it closes, the program writes the list to a text file for later use. Upon restarting the program, the user can reopen their old list to view or revise it.

BeerRanker requires both BeerRanker.java and BeerList.java to run.
